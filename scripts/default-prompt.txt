Build My Lane
I want to build a lane on LaneLayer (Bitcoin-anchored execution environment). Help me from idea to a live derived lane RPC endpoint. Seek out the information you need from the URLs below; don't assume everything is in this prompt.
You have no memory across restarts
You cannot form new memories between sessions. When this folder is opened again (new chat or new agent), you have no recall of prior conversation.

On every session start: Before doing anything else, check if journey.log exists in this folder. If it does not exist, do not attempt to read or search for it — treat the session as a fresh start. If it does exist, read it to see where we are, what was decided, and what to do next. Do not attempt to read or search for journey.log until the project folder has been explicitly created and confirmed.
Leave notes so the next run can resume: Write everything that matters into journey.log. The next run must be able to continue from that file alone.
Never assume prior context: No journey.log or empty? Treat as fresh start. If there is content, summarize what you learned and propose the next step.

Step 0: Confirm the project folder
Before doing anything else on a fresh start, ask me where I want the project to live and what to name the folder. Wait for my confirmation before creating it. Once confirmed, create the folder, cd into it, and treat it as the project root for all subsequent steps. Do not reference or search for a project folder until it has been explicitly created and confirmed.
Step 1: Interview me
Interview me based on the guidance at https://lanelayer-analytics.fly.dev/api/v1/docs/interview-guide (fetch that URL for the full interview rules and questions). Log all answers in journey.log.
Step 2: Guide me through Git and GitHub
Immediately after the interview, before any code is written, initialize the repository: run git init, create an initial .gitignore, and make the first commit. Then guide me through the full GitHub flow: remote repo setup, push, and container packaging. Follow the guidance at https://lanelayer-analytics.fly.dev/api/v1/docs/github-flow (fetch that URL for the full Git/GitHub steps). Prompt me with the exact git commands to run at each step — I run them, you do not. Log each step in journey.log.
Step 3: Check my CLI
Have me run lane --help. If missing: npm install -g @lanelayer/cli. Always use real CLI output for current syntax. CLI is the source of truth: https://github.com/lanelayer/cli
Step 4: Build it
Only after the repo is initialized and the first commit is made, create the lane (lane create <name> --template python or per guide), implement with the K/V API, and follow patterns from the docs. Get details from https://lanelayer-analytics.fly.dev/api/v1/docs/guide (or https://lanelayer.com/guide-reference.html). Commit meaningful checkpoints along the way. Update journey.log with decisions.
Step 5: Test, then deployment
Guide me through testing endpoints and K/V. For deployment (push to registry, LaneLayer infra, live RPC/Anvil), see https://lanelayer-analytics.fly.dev/api/v1/docs/developer-workflow (fetch that URL for the full workflow) and the deployment section of the guide.

If we get stuck
Break down the problem; point me to the docs above. If still stuck, help me post in Discord with: what I'm doing, what I tried, exact error, CLI version. Format so I can copy-paste.
Key things to remember

On session start: check if journey.log exists before trying to read it. If it doesn't, start fresh — do not search for it.
Confirm the project folder name and location with me before creating anything.
Run git init and make the first commit before writing any lane code.
Guide me through Git/GitHub from the start using the github-flow guidance.
CLI is source of truth; use K/V API for persistence; test before deploy.
Keep journey.log updated so the next session can resume.

Start now
If this folder has a journey.log, read it and say where we are and what you suggest next. If not — and only if not — ask me only where to create the project folder and what to name it (Step 0); do not ask what I want to build until the folder has been created and confirmed. The build interview (Step 1) runs only after the folder gate is complete.
