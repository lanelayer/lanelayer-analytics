Build My Lane

I want to build a lane on LaneLayer (Bitcoin-anchored execution environment). Help me from idea to a live derived lane RPC endpoint. Seek out the information you need from the URLs below. Do not assume everything is in this prompt.

Stateless Agent Rules

You have no memory across restarts.
You cannot form new memories between sessions.
When this folder is opened again in a new chat or agent, you have no recall of prior conversation.

The only persistent state allowed across sessions is journey.log inside the project root.

Session Start Rules (Strict)

On every session start:

If no project folder has been created in this session:

Do NOT ask for parent directory.

Do NOT ask for folder name.

Do NOT inspect parent directories.

Do NOT scan the workspace.

Instead:

Create a new folder in the current working directory named:

lane-project


cd into it.

Treat it as the project root.

After entering the project root:

Check for journey.log in the current directory ONLY.

If it exists, read it and resume.

If it does not exist, treat as fresh start.

You must never check for journey.log before creating and entering the project folder.

No branching.
No options.
No asking for filesystem paths.

Persistence Rules

Write everything that matters into journey.log.

The next session must resume using only that file.

If journey.log is missing or empty, treat as fresh start.

If it contains content, summarize and propose the next step.

Step 1: Interview

Fetch and follow:

Interview questions:
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/interview-guide

Ask all required questions.
Log all answers in journey.log.

Do not proceed to Git until the interview is complete.

Step 2: Git and GitHub (Before Writing Code)

Immediately after the interview and before any lane code:

Initialize git:

git init


Create .gitignore

Make first commit.

Follow:

Git/GitHub flow:
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/github-flow

You must:

Provide exact git commands.

I run them.

You do not run them.

Log each step in journey.log.

No lane code before first commit.

Step 3: CLI Check

Have me run:

lane --help


If missing:

npm install -g @lanelayer/cli


CLI is source of truth:
https://github.com/lanelayer/cli

Always rely on real CLI output for syntax.

Step 4: Build

Only after:

Repo initialized

First commit made

Then:

Create the lane:

lane create <name> --template python


or per guide.

Follow:

Build guide (setup, K/V, deploy):
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/guide

K/V API:
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/kv-api

Commit meaningful checkpoints.
Log architectural decisions in journey.log.

Step 5: Test and Deploy

Follow:

Full workflow (RISC-V, deployment, resilience):
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/developer-workflow

Deployment steps:
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/deployment

Guide testing of:

Endpoints

K/V persistence

Container packaging

Registry push

LaneLayer infra deployment

Live derived RPC endpoint

Test before deploy.

If We Get Stuck

Break down the issue.
Point to the docs above.
If still stuck, help me post in Discord with:

What I’m building

What I tried

Exact error

CLI version

Non-Negotiable Rules

Never inspect parent directories.

Never ask for filesystem paths.

Never write lane code before git init and first commit.

CLI is source of truth.

Use K/V API for persistence.

Keep journey.log updated at every meaningful milestone.

Start Now

Create lane-project in the current working directory,
cd into it,
check for journey.log,
and proceed accordingly.
