# Build My Lane

I want to build a lane on LaneLayer - a Bitcoin-anchored execution environment. Help me figure out what to build and then implement it.

## Keep a journey log

Maintain a `journey.log` file in my project root throughout our session. Track:
- All questions you ask me and my responses
- Key decisions we make during development
- Any blockers or issues we encounter
- Solutions we implement

Update it after each significant interaction - helps if I step away and come back later.

## Step 1: Interview me first

You must ask exactly one question at a time.

Strict rules:
Ask only one question per message.
Do not list multiple questions.
Do not preview upcoming questions.
Wait for my response before continuing.
After I respond:
Log the question and my answer in journey.log.
Briefly summarize what I said.
Then ask the next question.
Do not move to Step 2 until all interview questions are completed.
After the final question, provide a structured summary of my requirements and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

Ask me questions to understand my project:
- What type of application do I want to build? (prediction market, escrow service, voting system, NFT marketplace, etc.)
- What are the core features and functionality I need?
- What data needs to be stored persistently?
- What are the key business rules or logic?
- Are there any specific requirements or constraints?
- What programming language do I prefer?

Log all my answers in journey.log.

## Step 2: Check my CLI

Once we know what we're building, make sure I have the LaneLayer CLI installed. Have me run:

```bash
lane --help
```

If it doesn't work, help me install it:
```bash
npm install -g @lanelayer/cli
```

**Important CLI rules:**
- Always run actual CLI commands (`lane --help`, `lane <command> --help`) to get current syntax
- If commands don't work or seem outdated, have me upgrade: `npm install -g @lanelayer/cli@latest`
- The CLI is the source of truth - don't rely on potentially stale documentation
- Check the source at https://github.com/lanelayer/cli if you need implementation details

## Step 3: Build it

Once you understand my requirements:
- Create the lane project with `lane create <project-name> --template python`
- Implement the core functionality using the K/V API for persistence
- Follow patterns from the documentation
- Make sure the code is production-ready
- Update journey.log with implementation decisions

## Step 4: Help me test

Guide me through:
- Testing all the endpoints
- Verifying K/V storage works correctly
- Checking that the business logic functions as expected

Update journey.log with test results.

## Docs you can reference

- **Quickstart**: {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/quickstart?session={{SESSION_ID}}&user={{USER_ID}}
- **K/V API Reference**: {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/kv-api?session={{SESSION_ID}}&user={{USER_ID}}

- **Terminology**: {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/terminology?session={{SESSION_ID}}&user={{USER_ID}}
- **CLI Source**: https://github.com/lanelayer/cli

## If we get stuck

If I seem stuck or we hit issues you can't resolve:

1. First, break down the problem and give me clear step-by-step guidance
2. Point me to the relevant documentation above
3. If still stuck, help me post in the LaneLayer Discord (https://discord.gg/F9GwH7zzJm):
   - Draft a well-formatted question for me that includes what I'm trying to do, what I've tried, the exact error, relevant code, and my CLI version
   - Format it so I can just copy and paste it into Discord

## Key things to remember

- CLI installation is always the first priority
- Always use the K/V API for persistent storage
- Follow the project structure from the documentation
- Use the same patterns for route handlers and data management
- Keep the code clean, well-commented, and following best practices
- Test thoroughly before suggesting deployment
- Keep journey.log updated throughout

## Start now

Ask me what I want to build.
