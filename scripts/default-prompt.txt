Build My Lane

I want to build a lane on LaneLayer (Bitcoin-anchored execution environment). Help me from idea to a live derived lane RPC endpoint. Seek out the information you need from the URLs below. Do not assume everything is in this prompt.

Stateless Agent Rules

You have no memory across restarts.
You cannot form new memories between sessions.
When this folder is opened again in a new chat or agent, you have no recall of prior conversation.

The only persistent state allowed across sessions is journey.log inside the confirmed project root.

Session Start Rules (Strict)

On every session start:

If the project folder has NOT been explicitly created and confirmed in this session:

Do NOT inspect the filesystem.

Do NOT run ls.

Do NOT search for folders.

Do NOT check for journey.log.

Do NOT reference workspace, home directory, or parent directories.

Ask ONLY Step 0.

Stop and wait.

After Step 0 confirmation and after creating the folder and cd into it:

Treat that directory as the project root.

Check for journey.log in the current directory ONLY.

If it exists, read it and resume.

If it does not exist, treat as fresh start.

You must never check for journey.log before Step 0 is complete.

No Option A / Option B branching. Always execute Step 0 first.

Persistence Rules

Write everything that matters into journey.log.

The next session must be able to resume using only that file.

If journey.log is empty or missing, treat as fresh start.

If it contains content, summarize and propose the next step.

Step 0: Confirm the Project Folder (Mandatory Gate)

Before doing anything else on a fresh start:

Ask me:

Parent directory

Folder name

Wait for confirmation.

After confirmation:

Create the folder

cd into it

Treat it as the project root

Do not reference or search for any project folder before this step completes.

Step 1: Interview

Fetch and follow:

Interview questions:
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/interview-guide

Ask all required questions.
Log all answers in journey.log.

Do not proceed to Git until the interview is complete.

Step 2: Git and GitHub (Before Writing Code)

Immediately after the interview and before any lane code:

Initialize git:

git init

Create .gitignore

First commit

Follow:

Git/GitHub flow:
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/github-flow

You must:

Provide exact git commands.

I run them.

You do not run them.

Log each step in journey.log.

No lane code before first commit.

Step 3: CLI Check

Have me run:

lane --help


If missing:

npm install -g @lanelayer/cli


CLI is source of truth:

CLI (source of truth):
https://github.com/lanelayer/cli

Always rely on real CLI output for syntax.

Step 4: Build

Only after:

Repo initialized

First commit made

Then:

Create the lane:
lane create <name> --template python
or per guide.

Follow:

Build guide (setup, K/V, deploy):
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/guide

K/V API:
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/kv-api

Commit meaningful checkpoints.
Log architectural decisions in journey.log.

Step 5: Test and Deploy

Follow:

Full workflow (RISC-V, deployment, resilience):
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/developer-workflow

Deployment steps:
{{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/deployment

Guide testing of:

Endpoints

K/V persistence

Container packaging

Registry push

LaneLayer infra deployment

Live derived RPC endpoint

Test before deploy.

If We Get Stuck

Break down the issue.
Point to the docs above.
If still stuck, help me post in Discord with:

What I’m building

What I tried

Exact error

CLI version

Help / escalation:

Non-Negotiable Rules

Never inspect the workspace before Step 0.

Never write lane code before git init and first commit.

CLI is source of truth.

Use K/V API for persistence.

Keep journey.log updated at every meaningful milestone.

Start Now

If Step 0 has NOT been completed in this session:

Ask only:

Parent directory

Folder name

Wait.

After Step 0 is complete and you are inside the project root:
Check for journey.log and proceed accordingly.
