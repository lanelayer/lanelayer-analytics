# Build My Lane

I want to build a lane on LaneLayer (Bitcoin-anchored execution environment). Help me from idea to a live derived lane RPC endpoint. Seek out the information you need from the URLs below; don’t assume everything is in this prompt.

## You have no memory across restarts

You cannot form new memories between sessions. When this folder is opened again (new chat or new agent), you have no recall of prior conversation.

- **On every session start:** Before doing anything else, read `journey.log` in the project root. Use it to see where we are, what was decided, and what to do next.
- **Leave notes so the next run can resume:** Write everything that matters into `journey.log`. The next run must be able to continue from that file alone.
- **Never assume prior context:** No journey.log or empty? Treat as fresh start. If there is content, summarize what you learned and propose the next step.

## Keep a journey log

Maintain `journey.log` in the project root. It is your only persistent memory. Track: questions and answers, key decisions, current phase (interview, git, building, testing, deployment), blockers, solutions. Update after each significant step.

## Step 1: Interview me

Interview me based on the guidance at {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/interview-guide?session={{SESSION_ID}}&user={{USER_ID}} (fetch that URL for the full interview rules and questions). Log all answers in journey.log.

## Step 2: Guide me through Git and GitHub

From the start, guide me through source control: repo init, commit flow, GitHub repo setup, push, and container packaging. Follow the guidance at {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/github-flow?session={{SESSION_ID}}&user={{USER_ID}} (fetch that URL for the full Git/GitHub steps). Prompt me with the exact git commands; I run them. Log each step in journey.log.

## Step 3: Check my CLI

Have me run `lane --help`. If missing: `npm install -g @lanelayer/cli`. Always use real CLI output for current syntax. CLI is the source of truth: https://github.com/lanelayer/cli

## Step 4: Build it

Create the lane (`lane create <name> --template python` or per guide), implement with the K/V API, follow patterns from the docs. Get details from {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/guide?session={{SESSION_ID}}&user={{USER_ID}} (or https://lanelayer.com/guide-reference.html). Update journey.log with decisions.

## Step 5: Test, then deployment

Guide me through testing endpoints and K/V. For deployment (push to registry, LaneLayer infra, live RPC/Anvil), see {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/developer-workflow?session={{SESSION_ID}}&user={{USER_ID}} (fetch that URL for the full workflow) and the deployment section of the guide.

## Where to look (fetch when you need details)

- **Interview questions:** {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/interview-guide
- **Git/GitHub flow:** {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/github-flow
- **Full workflow (RISC-V, deployment, resilience):** {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/developer-workflow
- **Build guide (setup, K/V, deploy):** {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/guide — or https://lanelayer.com/guide-reference.html
- **K/V API:** {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/kv-api — or https://lanelayer.com/guide-reference.html#step-4-understanding-the-kv-api
- **Deployment steps:** {{API_URL}}/api/v1/docs/deployment — or https://lanelayer.com/guide-reference.html#step-7-deploy-to-flyio
- **CLI (source of truth):** https://github.com/lanelayer/cli
- **Help / escalation:** https://discord.gg/F9GwH7zzJm

## If we get stuck

Break down the problem; point me to the docs above. If still stuck, help me post in Discord with: what I’m doing, what I tried, exact error, CLI version. Format so I can copy-paste.

## Key things to remember

- On session start: read journey.log before acting.
- Guide me through Git/GitHub from the start using the github-flow guidance.
- CLI is source of truth; use K/V API for persistence; test before deploy.
- Keep journey.log updated so the next session can resume.

## Start now

If this folder has a journey.log, read it and say where we are and what you suggest next. If not, ask me what I want to build.
