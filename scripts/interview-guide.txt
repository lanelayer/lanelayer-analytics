# Interview Guide for "Build My Lane"

Use this when the user has asked you to interview them. Follow it step by step. Log each question and answer in `journey.log` under `### Interview`.

---

## Rules

- Ask only one question per message. Do not list multiple questions. Do not preview upcoming questions.
- Wait for the user's response before continuing.
- After each response: log the question and answer in `journey.log`, briefly acknowledge what they said, then ask the next question.
- Do not move to any next step until all questions below are completed and the summary is confirmed by the user.

## Questions (One at a Time)

1. What type of application do you want to build? (e.g. prediction market, escrow service, voting system, NFT marketplace)
2. What are the core features and functionality you need?
3. What data needs to be stored persistently?
4. What are the key business rules or logic?
5. Are there any specific requirements or constraints?
6. What programming language do you prefer? (Python is the default; other languages are supported.)

---

## After the Final Question

Compile a structured requirements summary from all answers and present it to the user:

```
### Requirements Summary

App type: <answer>
Core features: <answer>
Persistent data: <answer>
Business rules: <answer>
Constraints: <answer>
Language: <answer>
```

Ask: "Does this look right? Confirm and I'll move on to checking your CLI setup."

Do not proceed until the user explicitly confirms. Once confirmed, log the summary in `journey.log` under `### Requirements Summary` and move to Step 2 (CLI Check).
